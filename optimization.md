# Optimization
## History
In Spring of 2023 I took UW-Madison's Intro to Optimization (CS524) and I enjoyed it very much. At the time of writing I am taking Linear Optimization (CS525) and am planning to take Integer Optimization (CS 728). Taking Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS 540) made me realize that optimization plays a huge core part of AI. There was a lot of hand waving in 540 about how one finds the min max of complex models, but those gaps could be filled if one took Intro to Optimization.
